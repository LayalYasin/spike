`Snakemake` greatly supports execution of a pipeline on a grid compute system with very little overhead. However, it will help reading Snakemake's own documentation to get familiar with with basic concepts and commands: https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executable.html#cluster-execution

We are here listing our best practice experience running `spike` on the `High Performance Computing` (HPC) system at University of Duesseldorf: https://www.zim.hhu.de/high-performance-computing.html Great people support users on the HPC via https://rocketchat.hhu.de/ or by phone or email and it is definitively worth reading their Wiki https://wiki.hhu.de/display/HPC/Wissenschaftliches+Hochleistungs-Rechnen+am+ZIM **before** submitting thousands of jobs to their grid.
